	<p>An unidentified man began convulsing on the sidewalk at 8:30 p.m. Friday, June 30, on the 3600 block of West Addison Street, one block from Wrigley Field. </p>
	<p>A crowd quickly gathered around the man who fell outside of the doors at the CTA Red Line Addison station. Onlookers yelled for someone to call an ambulance as others attempted to keep the man on his side and keep the man’s head stable during the episode.</p>
	<p>Two Chicago police officers who were at the scene called for medical assistance and asked for cars on West Addison Street to clear space for the firetruck that was en route.</p>
	<p>When the victim regained consciousness, he was bleeding from the head and did not know where he was. He tried to walk away, yelling for people to let him go.</p>
	<p>People at the scene, including one man who reportedly knew the victim, tried to calm the man down and asked him to wait for medical assistance to arrive.</p>
	
	<p>At 8:43 p.m., engine No. 55 from the Chicago Fire Department arrived at the scene and its crew attempted to give the man medical attention, sitting him down inside the CTA station and briefly evaluating him.</p>

	“I did not know him,” McNally said, who was crying and visibly shaken by the event. “I saw a man in trouble and I just wanted to help.”

	<p>CTA employee Cecelia Holloway, who witnessed the incident, said the man refused further medical attention, did not provide the responders with a name, and left shortly after to a bar in the area. </p>
	<p>According to fire department spokesperson Cmdr. Frank Velez, an individual is not required to receive further medical attention if a unit is dispatched to a scene.</p>
	<p>“If a person ends up being deemed competent, you cannot physically force them to go to the hospital,” Velez said. “We have to document them accordingly. We have to call medical control and let them know they have refused assistance.”</p>
	<p>The department who responded to Friday night’s incident would have made a call of refusal of assistance to the Advocate Illinois Medical Center, according to Velez.</p>
	<p>Danielle McNally, who was a lifeguard for 1.5 years and said she has first aid and CPR experience, saw the victim on the ground and went to his side to help.</p>
	<p>According to McNally, she tried to turn the man on his side and keep his head stable; however, people who knew the victim told her to leave him alone.</p>
	<p>“I did not know him,” McNally said, who was crying and visibly shaken by the event. “I saw a man in trouble and I just wanted to help.”</p>
	<p>A police department officer who responded to the incident refused to give an official statement when asked about the protocol of allowing individuals to be released after medical assistance has been dispatched to a scene.</p>
	<p>This incident occurred during a Dead & Company concert at Wrigley Field.</p>
	<p>The man has yet to be identified.</p>
